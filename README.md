# Supplementary Information: *Assessment and modeling of the isobaric vapor-liquid-liquid equilibrium for water + cyclopentyl methyl ether + alcohol (ethanol or propan-1-ol) ternary mixtures*

This repository is part of the Supplementary Information of the article *Assessment and modeling of the isobaric vapor-liquid-liquid equilibrium for water + cyclopentyl methyl ether + alcohol (ethanol or propan-1-ol) ternary mixtures* by Andrés Mejía, Marcela Cartes, Gustavo Chaparro and Erich A. Müller. (Submmited to ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering)

This repository include examples of how to perform stability analysis and phase equilibria calculations for three-phase equilibria of the ternary mixture of Water (1) + CPME (2) + Ethanol (3) using SAFT-VR-Mie Equation of State.


### Examples

The following calculations are included in the [``examples``](./examples) folder.

1. Phase Stability Exploration for Water (1) + CPME (2) + Ethanol (3)
2. Three phase equilibria calculation for Water (1) + CPME (2) + Ethanol (3)
